          <p>In Summer 2019, I finished my first co op term at Bell Canada, I worked in the automation/technology team and took on various projects and tasks. I got to learn a lot and developed new skills which I know will help me a lot for the career path I have chosen. Internships are great because they give a person experience in the field and makes them evaluate if the career field is the right fit for them.</p>



        <p>During my co-op experience, I got to work on various things. One of the things I completed was creating a Python Script helped you connect to a SSH Client , you were able to capture data from various hosts using file input, run commands, able to create and store data in files, with error counts, progress checks and time stamps. This was used to create backups for large number of devices, making the process 93% more effeicent than before.</p>



        <p>I also took on other projects like creating various visual KPI's such as workload management boards and agile boards to track the number of reports completed by employees. I worked on creating an employees surveys and satisfaction plan, an end to end solution to improve wellness in the workplace. I Performed testing on Cisco codecs to ensure security for all the network information and user interface. I helped the team with their yearly initiatives such as creating collections for cutting down on alarms and tickets. </p>


       <p> Working at Bell Canada was a really fun and insightful experience, some of the skills I got to pick up on was time management, learning python from scratch, presentation skills and learn softwares such as Confluence/Jira.   </p>
